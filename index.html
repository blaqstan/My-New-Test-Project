			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>I should introduce myself here and talk about why I delved into Website Development even as I can not deny my undying love for cryptocurrency, Web3 and DeFi.</p>

		<div class="feature">
			<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
			<p>I didn't just come into the crypto and Web3 space to hunt for airdrops, I came to learn about the underlying technology behind Bitcoin and by extension all other cryptcurrencies while appreciating and immersing myself into them.</p>
